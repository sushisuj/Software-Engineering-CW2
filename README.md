- Gui 
– Application 
– Database 
- 7 Preset recipes + Add your own option (with calories)

User requirements collection:

Following the completion of our primary research into user requirements, valuable insights were obtained regarding the relative importance and desirability of various proposed features. The data, collected through user surveys, provided a clear indication of user preferences and priorities. The results revealed that certain functionalities, such as automatic portion control and the built-in timer, were less favored among participants. Consequently, after a thorough analysis and consolidation of the findings, these features were removed from the final requirements list to ensure that the product remains aligned with user expectations and practical usage patterns.Quantitative analysis of the survey responses further reinforced these decisions. The average user ratings demonstrated consistent support for the features deemed most essential to the application’s success: Offline Functionality (3.6/5), Filtering Options (3.6/5), Meal Calendar (3.7/5), and Recipe Notes (3.7/5). These scores reflect a positive reception and a strong perceived value among users, particularly for features that enhance usability, personalization, and accessibility.As a result, the development team decided to focus its efforts on refining and implementing these four core functionalities. This strategic focus will allow for a more user-centered product design, promoting higher engagement and ensuring an efficient, reliable, and satisfying user experience that aligns closely with the needs and expectations identified through our research.
